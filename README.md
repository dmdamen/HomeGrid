# HomeGrid

A hobby project for creating my own IoT platform for home usage.

Principles:

* The system should communicate using available WiFi networks
* Communication between 'things' and hub using MQTT (Using TLS)
* Workflow based on NodeRed
* Secure OTA updates
* Devices should be easy to connect
